# Bank api 

## To run the app

### 1. Create a virtual enviroment (optional)

go to the root and execute 

`python -m venv project`

then 

`cd project`

`cd Scripts`

`activate`

### 2. install requirements 

*this app was made using python 3.11.9

go to backend and execute 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 3. run the app 

execute 

`python manage.py runserver`

and you can start calling the api

### 4. considerations

- For simplicity the verification of the ibans is made with the schwifty library, I would rather do it calling the IBAN official api 
for the verification

- To paginate you have to add at the last part of the url a ?page={number of page/last/first}

- There is a JSON file called bank.postman_collection with a collection to test the api in local with postman

- The API is connected to a PSQL database hosted on Aiven, the conection was made without env variables for simplicity
